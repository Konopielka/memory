Hello, 
I've started programming due to my passion in computer programs such us SolidWorks, Gimp, Blender, Unity, ...and 3d printing :).
Some time later I have notice that everything what I learned there as normal user isn't enought to satisfy me, 
so I have started coding to make my hobbies even more proffesional. But first I need to achive a higher level in it to be able to connect these worlds.
I hope that some day it will be possible, thats why I need some professional advise.
